          <p>
            Given the relative youth, complexity, and risk associated with the cryptocurrency industry, there is often a sense of dissatisfaction and lack of confidence due to a dearth of accessible information. At &Volume, we believe that trust should be built on transparency and integrity. Sometimes, it's necessary to start from scratch to create something superior.
          </p>
          <p>
            &Volume is precisely geared towards this mission – to bring the cryptocurrency industry out of the shadows. We offer an optimal path to grow your savings. Our users have the ability to monitor how their funds are being invested, all while retaining full control; we never require any fund transfers.
          </p>
          <p>
            What sets us apart from competitors is our provision of a fully automated system designed to yield profits from daily cryptocurrency trading. Besides choosing your risk level, our approach necessitates no prior experience or additional user actions.

            <h2>&Volume took its first steps in Scotland</h2>

          <p>
            Originally, our vision was to create an automated trading system for traditional stock and foreign exchange markets. However, the high costs associated with obtaining a brokerage license temporarily diverted our path. Consequently, we redirected all our efforts towards the crypto market.
          </p>
          <p>
            During our time at the University of Edinburgh, as part of our Master's thesis, we initiated the development of a prototype project. The initial working title was Project Garuda.
          </p>
          <p>
            The university played a pivotal role, offering invaluable support. We gained access to cutting-edge AI research, received guidance in analyzing the idea in light of contemporary trends and scientific findings. A special note of gratitude to our mentors at Student Enterprise for their guidance in refining the idea and for connecting us with valuable industry contacts. The educational resources, training materials, seminars, and courses provided by the university were instrumental in comprehensively developing the idea from its conceptual stage to a functional product.
