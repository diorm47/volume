              <h2>1. Our Guiding Principles</h2>
              <p>
                Мы ориентируемся на понятную цель — зарабатывать для клиентов,
                при этом не отнимая у них время.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our primary objective is clear-cut: to generate returns for our
                clients without consuming their valuable time. Our existing and
                forthcoming offerings are grounded in three fundamental
                principles:
              </p>
              <h3>1. Efficiency</h3>
              <p>
                In order to deliver substantial returns, we ensure our
                cryptocurrency trading automation technologies remain aligned
                with market dynamics. We consistently test and incorporate
                successful trading strategies into our artificial intelligence
                model. All our strategies are firmly rooted in empirical and
                academic research.
              </p>
              <h3>2. Transparency</h3>
              <p>
                Clients have unfettered access to information regarding the
                management of their funds. Details concerning transactions,
                commissions, profits, and balances are readily accessible
                through your personal &Volume account as well as your exchange
                account. Our service pricing is transparent, contingent on
                deposit volume, and devoid of hidden charges. Any minor
                alterations to the terms of service are communicated well in
                advance.
              </p>
              <p>
                &Volume is structured to minimize and resolve conflicts of
                interest that may arise among us, clients, and exchanges.
              </p>
              <h3>3. Security</h3>
              <p>
                Client funds are securely held in their exchange accounts and
                remain accessible at all times. We strictly adhere to the core
                principle of non-involvement in the withdrawal or transfer of
                these funds. This principle guides our development of new
                products for traditional stock and foreign exchange markets.
              </p>
              <p>
                We neither gather nor retain personal information. Our
                utilization of analytics tools, such as Google Analytics, is
                strictly for anonymous user activity analysis. This data aids us
                in enhancing interfaces, ensuring a user-friendly experience on
                both the website and &Volume personal account.

              <h2>2. Methodology</h2>
              <p>
                In this section, we delve into the fundamental concepts of
                artificial intelligence, the technological underpinnings of
                &Volume, and evaluate its effectiveness and capabilities.
              </p>
              <p>
                The term artificial intelligence (AI) encompasses endeavors to
                devise algorithms capable of emulating human-like actions
                (Winston, 1984). AI can manifest as software operating on
                computers, servers, or integrated into chips within smartphones,
                automobiles, and household appliances. Consequently, any
                algorithm where one action hinges on another can be construed as
                an instantiation of artificial intelligence.
              </p>
              <p>
                Researchers delineate three categories of AI: weak (Narrow AI),
                strong (General AI), and super-intelligence (Super AI) (Patel,
                et al., 2020). Presently, all existing forms of AI, including
                voice assistants and text and graphical generative models such
                as GPT-4 and Midjourney, fall under the rubric of weak AI.
              </p>
              <p>
                The distinction between weak and strong AI lies in the latter's
                self-awareness and approximation to human intelligence (Turing,
                1950).
              </p>
              <p>
                Nevertheless, the adoption of AI through deep machine learning
                is considered by some scholars as a pivotal step towards
                achieving strong AI (Daudov et al., 2020).
              </p>
              <p>
                Neural networks, a subset of artificial intelligence, constitute
                a machine learning technique that mirrors the architecture of
                the human brain for processing intricate data. Comprising
                numerous interconnected neurons, they engage in the processing
                and transmission of information amongst themselves. Each neuron
                receives input, processes it, and transmits the outcome to the
                subsequent neuron (Picton and Picton, 1994).
              </p>
              <p>
                Several categories of neural networks exist, including forward,
                recurrent, and convolutional (Tkáč and Verner, 2016). Each
                possesses distinct characteristics and finds application
                contingent on the specific task at hand.
              </p>
              <p>
                Neural networks find utility in automating speech and image
                recognition, natural language processing, and predictive
                modeling, among other domains. They can be trained on extensive
                datasets for tasks such as classification, clustering, and
                prediction. In decision-making contexts, including financial
                markets, machine learning algorithms draw upon data derived from
                neural networks, which can learn autonomously or under
                supervision.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div id="section2_1">
              <h3>2.1 Foundation of the AI Model</h3>
              <p>
                In essence, at &Volume, we employ a blend of tools, comprising a
                data collection system, an array of neural networks for data
                processing, and an algorithmic decision-making system grounded
                in machine learning.
              </p>
              <p>
                The data collection system channels information from diverse
                sources to the neural networks for processing. Subsequently, the
                processed data is relayed to the decision-making system for
                interpretation. Following this, the system determines whether to
                initiate a transaction, selects the position's direction, and
                identifies the optimal selling moment.
              </p>
              <p>
                Figure 1 illustrates the overarching model utilized by &Volume
                to prognosticate trade profitability. The initial step involves
                aggregating all requisite data to train and assess the
                predictive model. This data may be subjected to processing,
                transformation, or purification to eliminate extraneous noise,
                retaining only pertinent information. The processed data is then
                employed for model training. At the validation phase,
                hyperparameters undergo optimization. Ultimately, the tuned
                model proceeds through a testing phase to appraise the outcomes.
              </p>

              </p>
              <p>
                For trading determinations, &Volume relies on machine learning
                algorithms overseen by a mentor, alongside algorithms featuring
                a classical reinforcement learning loop (Figure 2). In
                mentor-guided algorithms, the role of the mentor is assumed by
                ML programmers and professionals with expertise in both stock
                and crypto market trading, who assess the system's
                decision-making and rectify as needed.
              </p>
              <img src="./assets/icons/ai-2.svg" alt="" />
              <p class="picture_text">
                Figure 2. Classical reinforcement learning loop model (2023).
              </p>
              <p>
                Thus, our AI model assumes a hybrid nature, amalgamating
                distinct components into a unified system. As posited by Nazari
                et al. (2022), hybrid AI models, formed through the integration
                of various machine learning techniques, offer advantages over
                homogeneous counterparts. Each individual model within the
                hybrid framework bolsters the overall system's performance.
              </p>
              <p>
                This hybrid AI model adeptly foresees daily price trends and
                executes profitable transactions within a 24-hour timeframe
                (Patel et al., 2020). Nevertheless, conducting transactions over
                a lengthier trading day horizon translates to heightened
                profitability rates. Hence, our primary strategy currently
                centers on managing finances in day trading, rather than the
                medium to long term.
              </p>
              <p>
                Over extended periods, such as seven days, the model's efficacy
                diminishes noticeably, alongside its profitability ratio (Patel
                et al., 2020).
              </p>
              <p>
                A pivotal benefit of an AI model lies in its absence of
                emotions. Even accomplished traders grapple with substantial
                losses attributable to impulsive actions driven by unbridled
                emotions (Astor et al., 2015). Emotions can precipitate
                impromptu decisions. Thoughtful planning and disciplined
                strategy can serve as safeguards against this, and AI mitigates
                the risk of emotional decision-making, thereby averting major
                losses.
              </p>

                relation to alternative investment instruments are expounded

              <p>
                Trading range, also known as mean reversion, operates on the
                premise that prices have a tendency to revert to their mean
                (Wang et al, 2016). Our approach draws from the strategy
                expounded in the academic work of Leoung & Lee (2015). We
                pinpoint instances where an asset's price deviates significantly
                from its historical average, often due to overbuying or
                overselling. We then initiate trades with the expectation that,
                within a specified timeframe, the price will return to its
                average from several cycles prior.
              </p>
              <p>
                In deploying a mean reversion strategy, we employ classical
                technical indicators such as moving averages and Bollinger Bands
                (Bollinger, 1992), alongside other intricate factors. Moving
                averages gauge an asset's historical price average, while
                Bollinger Bands, leveraging volatility metrics like standard
                deviation, assist in discerning significant deviations from the
                average market value (Bollinger, 2002). To effectively implement
                this strategy, we found it imperative to adapt and augment the
                AI model with more sophisticated conditions, as an excessive
                reliance on technical indicators would result in diminished
                profitability when trading crypto pairs.
              </p>
              <p>
                The mean reversion strategy can be applied across various
                timeframes, encompassing longer-term ones (Bollinger, 2002).
                Nonetheless, owing to specific factors and constraints inherent
                to crypto exchanges, we exclusively employ this strategy for
                short-term intraday trading. At &Volume, this strategy is
                grounded in statistical analysis and the identification of
                abnormal price movements. Upon detecting a price deviation, the
                AI system generates signals to initiate trades in the opposite
                direction of the deviation (Figure 3).

              <p>
                In mean reversion trades, our AI evaluates the probability of a
                price reversal and establishes appropriate stop-loss levels to
                mitigate potential losses if mean reversion fails to
                materialize. Our AI model integrates statistical analysis, risk
                management methodologies, and ongoing scrutiny of market
                dynamics.

              <h3>Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP).</h3>
              <p>
                The volume-weighted average price strategy involves breaking
                down a substantial order and strategically placing smaller
                segments into the market based on historical volume profiles for
                specific positions. The objective is to execute the order in
                proximity to the Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) determined
                by a general (Figure 4) or specialized formula.

              <h3>Time-Weighted Average Price (TWAP).</h3>
              <p>
                With the time-weighted average price strategy, we divide large
                trades into intervals and dispatch smaller, AI-determined order
                segments to the market at evenly spaced time intervals between
                the commencement and conclusion times. Our aim is to fulfill the
                order at the average price between these time boundaries,
                thereby minimizing the market impact of high-volume entry into a
                market with limited trading volume.
              </p>
              <h3>Percentage of Volume (POV)</h3>
              <p>
                Until the trade order is entirely filled, our AI system
                continually dispatches partial orders based on the defined
                participation rate and market trading volume. This volume
                percentage strategy, also known as a step strategy, involves our
                AI system placing orders at an automatically determined
                percentage of market volumes. When the price of the
                cryptocurrency reaches a predetermined level, the AI adjusts
                this participation level accordingly.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition to these methodologies, we incorporate several other
                algorithmic strategies with the overarching aim of discerning
                the actions of other market participants. These algorithms
                within our AI model enable us to discern the actions of systems
                akin to ours on either the buy or sell side of a large order.
                This discernment aids us in identifying opportunities involving
                large orders, enabling us to execute orders at a more
                advantageous price point. Such maneuvers are referred to as AI
                advance development (Hens et al., 2018). We strictly adhere to
                the rules and regulations set forth by the Financial Industry
                Regulatory Authority (FINRA), given that forward action
                practices may be subject to legal scrutiny depending on the
                circumstances and are heavily regulated (FINRA, 2013; FINMA,
                2023; FCA, 2023, ESMA, 2023).

                Even when a strategy is implemented competently at the right
                time, it does not guarantee the absence of unprofitable
                transactions. To mitigate losses, we continuously evaluate
                various strategies using historical data.

              <p>
                The rationale behind focusing the service on trading
                cryptocurrency pairs lies in our belief that this constitutes
                one of the most effective realms of financial management. When
                weighing risk against return, cryptocurrency trading, with
                certain caveats, appears more appealing compared to conventional
                investment vehicles such as bank deposits, savings accounts,
                trust management, and the like.
              </p>
              <p>
                To gauge benchmark efficiency, let's delve into trading
                statistics using a month-long example (Figure 5).
              </p>

              <p>
                The vertical axis represents the account balance, while the
                horizontal axis denotes the number of transactions. Commencing
                with a stable coin balance of USDT 100, equivalent to $100, our
                system executed a total of 681 trades within the month. Of
                these, 299 trades yielded losses, while 382 were profitable. The
                most adverse outcome amounted to -$6.91, while the most
                favorable outcome stood at +$3.3. Throughout the month, the
                balance exhibited uneven growth, punctuated by intermittent
                drawdowns. These drawdowns are a consequence of the
                specificities inherent to our trading strategy and the
                functioning of the AI model. The cumulative weight of profitable
                trades gradually elevated profitability, culminating in a
                month-end balance of $152.02, or a 52% increase. Over a span of
                up to 12 months, the average efficiency approximates to ~360%
                annually.

              <p>
                In the UK, the average interest rate for deposits typically
                ranges from 1% to 5% annually. However, most options do not
                entail monthly interest accrual, meaning there is no
                compounding, and payments are only provided at the end of the
                term. The most favorable interest rates are usually offered on
                fixed deposits that do not allow for partial withdrawals or
                additional deposits. This type of investment does not
                necessitate prior experience, and all deposits are safeguarded
                by the government's FSCS scheme, providing coverage up to
                £85,000 (FSCS, 2023). Consequently, the risk of investment loss
                is very low, making it suitable for safeguarding significant
                savings over the long term.
              </p>
              <p>
                Nonetheless, this form of investment is susceptible to a high
                risk of losses due to inflation. For instance, in 2022,
                depositors experienced substantial monetary losses, with UK
                inflation reaching 11% (NY Times, 2022). This figure is more
                than twice the highest interest rate offered on a deposit.

              <p>
                In European countries (EU plus Switzerland), the average
                interest rate for deposits typically ranges from 0.1% to 4%. In
                most cases, interest is compounded monthly, and there's an
                option for capitalization. It's worth noting that within the EU,
                there isn't currently a unified deposit insurance system; each
                country has its own policy. For instance, in Germany, the state
                insures deposits up to 100,000 euros under the DSGV scheme
                (Europa, 2023).
              </p>
              <p>
                Similar to other forms of investment, this type is also
                susceptible to a high risk of loss due to inflation. For
                example, in 2022, inflation in European countries was at 9%
                (Inflation Tool, 2023). In 2023, it's anticipated to be 5%

                most US banks are not incentivizing residents to deposit money,
                as they offer rates that are notably below the inflation rate.
                It's crucial to highlight that all deposits up to $250,000 in US
                banks are insured by the government agency FDIC (FDIC, 2023).

                In Russia, the average annual inflation rate for 2022 was
                approximately 12%, with some months seeing it rise as high as
                17% (CBR, 2023). Concurrently, the average bank deposit rate
                ranges from 6% to 12% annually, typically involving
                capitalization of the amount and monthly interest disbursements.
                In essence, deposits have the potential to mitigate the risks

                The majority of neobanks provide flexible terms. For instance,
                when utilizing Revolut and Wise, your account balance can accrue
                interest daily at a rate of 4% to 5% per annum. In most cases,
                an investment fund oversees these funds. For instance, in Wise,
                Revolut, and Monzo, BlackRock manages the funds, which are
                invested in a variety of assets including funds, bonds, and

              <h3>3.8 Conclusion on Profitability</h3>
              <h3>Banks:</h3>
              <p>
                Investing in bank deposits is the least risky way to save money,
                requiring no additional knowledge. In most countries, deposits
                up to a certain amount are insured by the state in the event of
                bank failure. However, considering inflation, this method at
                best preserves the amount or incurs a slight loss, contingent on
                the level of inflation in a given period. Typically, funds in
                the deposit are not readily accessible, and premature closure
                may result in interest recalculation at a minimum rate.
              </p>
              <h3>Neobanks:</h3>
              <p>
                Utilizing neobanks as an investment tool can yield bank interest
                rates or slightly higher. In most cases, funds are accessible,
                and interest accrues on a daily or monthly basis. No specialized
                knowledge is necessary. However, it's imperative to note that
                funds are not insured, entailing a risk of investment loss.
              </p>

              <h3>Investment Funds:</h3>
              <p>
                Investment funds typically allocate clients' capital based on
                the level of risk, into funds, bonds, indices, and stocks. On
                average, returns on such investments surpass bank interest
                rates. However, this type of investment requires a solid
                understanding of market dynamics and the broader economy. Funds
                are not insured, and the risk of investment loss ranges from
                moderate to high.
              </p>
              <h3>&Volume</h3>
              <p>
                Employing the riskiest form of investment management -
                cryptocurrency day trading - &Volume provides clients full
                control over their deposit. Transactions are executed around the
                clock, with results visible daily. The risk of losses is
                cyclical, generally higher than with investment funds, and
                contingent entirely on market conditions. No specialized
                knowledge is required. Despite the elevated risk, the returns
                from such investments far surpass bank interest on deposits and
                significantly outstrip the returns from investment funds.

              <h3>Recommendations</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    When making any investment decision, we recommend that you
                    carefully consider all factors and understand your
                    investment objective.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Most experts advise not to invest all your savings in one
                    instrument, but to divide your savings into several
                    instruments so that most of the funds are most reliably
                    protected (SEC, 2023).
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Spreading your money across different types of investments,
                    such as international stocks and bonds, can reduce your
                    risks. In a properly diversified mix of investments, if any
                    particular investment or market performs poorly, the
                    performance of other investments can help maintain overall
                    returns and mitigate the impact of losses (FCA, 2023).
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>
                Key conditions for financial success according to the SEC:
              </h3>
              <p>
                Make a financial plan. Pay off all high interest debts. Start
                saving and investing as soon as you pay off your debts.

              <h3>Risk Warning.</h3>
              <p>&Volume is an investment instrument with increased risk.</p>
              <p>
                Investments always involve risk. Your capital may increase or
                decrease, and you may not always be able to recoup the entire
                amount you invest. Past performance is not a guarantee of future
                results.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    You may lose all the money you invest.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The state of most crypto assets can be very unstable: their
                    value falls as quickly as it rises. You should be prepared
                    to lose all the money you invest in crypto assets and
                    cryptocurrency trading.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    The crypto-asset market is practically unregulated. There is
                    a risk of losing money or any crypto assets purchased due to
                    risks such as cyber attacks, financial crimes and exchange
                    failure.
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Don't expect that your money is insured if something goes
                    wrong. Cryptocurrency and cryptocurrency trading is not a
                    regulated activity and is not insured by any government.
                    <br />
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Putting all your
                    money into one type of investment is risky. Spreading your
                    money across different investments makes you less dependent
                    on which one will do well
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    A good rule of thumb is to not invest more than 10% of your
                    money in high-risk investments.

              <h2>Project Roadmap</h2>
              <p>
                The original idea of the project was to provide automated
                trading services in traditional stock and foreign exchange
                markets. However, entry into the traditional market is blocked
                by a strong regulatory barrier, which requires enormous initial
                investment to overcome. Therefore, we began the development of
                the project from the cryptocurrency market, as it is less
                regulated and open to experimentation.
              </p>

                    Project Launch Stage <br />
                    <br />
                    At the first stage, we launched the main service - automated
                    management of trading in crypto-pairs. At the moment, this
                    is our primary product, with a very low barrier to entry.
                    After load testing on a limited audience of up to 5,000
                    people, the project will be launched for a wider audience.

                    Enable Pro Mode <br />
                    <br />
                    Initially, no user settings for our system are provided.
                    However, at the second stage, we will grant access to some
                    settings. To change system settings without compromising
                    efficiency, the user must have certain knowledge in trading.
                    We'll also expand the number of supported crypto exchanges.
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    For users who trade cryptocurrency on their own, we are
                    preparing to release our own trading terminal with a
                    built-in connection to our AI system.

                    Expansion of Investment Methods. <br />
                    <br />
                    In addition to automated trading, we plan to add tools for
                    long-term investment in crypto, automated purchase of crypto
                    assets in long-term mode, as well as automated balancing of
                    the investment portfolio.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    To manage the balancing of crypto-portfolios in the medium
                    and long-term modes, we are developing an automated
                    sentiment analysis system based on open language models.

                    We plan to accumulate enough liquidity to independently or
                    through an umbrella broker begin to provide automated
                    trading services for short-, medium-, and long-term
